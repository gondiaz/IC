    detector.
    pes (from photoelecton): a vector with the photoelectrons produced in the detector in
    each of the buffer times in times argument.
    bins: a vector with the output waveform bin times (for example [0, 25, 50, ...] if
    the detector has a sampling time of 25).
    nsamples: an integer that controlls the distribution of the photoelectrons in each of
    the waveform bins. The counts (N) in a given time bin (T) are distributed in the waveform
    such as the nsamples posterior to T would have N/nsamples counts (included T).
